# BitcoinPricePrediction
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that started in 2008. In 2010, the price of a bitcoin was $0.08, and by the end of 2017, the price of a bitcoin reached $19,783. That would've been quite the investment! In this workshop, we will take you through a step-by-step process for predicting bitcoin prices. We will analyze how the data changed over the years and how we can choose the right machine learning model for solving this prediction problem. You will be introduced to a deep learning model that predicts future bitcoin prices by traveling through time (cool stuff!).
